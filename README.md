This repo is created with sample code to show how to implement Test Automation with Python abd BDD Framework
## Install ##
1. download pythod - https://www.python.org/downloads/
    * Make sure to add python home directory and python scripts directory to your PATH environment variable
2. Download latest version of allure framework: https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2/releases

## Run Test ##
1. Tests are defined in the features directory as feature files.  This example only contains a single file, getAPI.feature
    * stepImpl.py defines the implementation of the steps needed to be executed from the feature file(s)
    * when tests are run using behave, all feature files under the features directory are exercised by default
2. Run the tests

```bash
behave -f allure_behave.formatter:AllureFormatter -o Reports
